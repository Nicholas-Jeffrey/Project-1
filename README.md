# Nick's Anime Watchlist

Nick's Anime Watchlist is a site dedicated to myself and fellow otakus who are interested in keeping up with the anime I am currently watching and animes I have wathed before and which ones I recomend to watch. More importantly it is my submission for my code institute project one(1). Nick's ANime watchlist will be useful to demonstrates the knowledge gained from the course thus far and my ability as a web developer.
